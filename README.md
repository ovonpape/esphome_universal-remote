# HassBeam
A cheap and easy to use universal remote that can be integrated into Home Assistant using ESPHome.  
It allows you to replace your pile of different remote controls with one stationary device that can be controlled via Home Assistant. Of course, you can also automate the control of your IR devices.

## ✅  Requirements
To use this project, you will need a working [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) instance, as the universal remote integrates directly with it. The core of the device is an ESP32 micro controller, which communicates with Home Assistant via [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/).

In addition to the ESP32, a few electronic components are required — see the [Parts](hardware.md#parts) section for details. 

Optionally, design files for a custom PCB or perfboard layout are provided, along with a 3D-printable case for the device.
